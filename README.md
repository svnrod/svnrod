1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

  - User stories are a great way to interpret user needs. User Stories enable developers to put on the consumer's shoes and view the product or
  feature from the user's point of view. Because of this, it is easier to undestand what task needs to be done as well as how they should be done.
  
2. How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

  - The agile processes I hope to incorporate into my future work is related to it's values and it's sense of adaptability. As with anything, especially in programming when trying to develop a project, many things could change and an entire project in itself may change. Because of this, it is important to be able to adapt to any change.

3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

  - There's a ton of values and aspects to being a good team member in software development. Some of these include being a good communicator, someone is committed to the project and vision, someone who isn't selfish and instead works selflessly for the entire team, and someone who is open to working with and helping others. Being a good team member is extremely important for the health and efficieny of any team project, everyone must strive to be a good team member if one wants to be successful in this industry.
